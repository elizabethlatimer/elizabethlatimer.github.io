            <h3>Hi! I'm Elizabeth.</h3>
            <p>I am a Software Engineer newly graduated from Rithm School, a full-stack software development bootcamp.
                I excel in creative, relationship-oriented problem solving, and I am excited to continue the discovery of
                how my new technical skills can be used to help solve problems for people.
                I am always excited to learn something new,
                especially when it expands the tools I have at my disposal.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you take a look at my work history, you'll see that, until recently, my work has been in education administration,
                and you might be wondering, why the switch? I've been interested in shaping people's online experiences
                since the days of Neopets and Myspace.
                Through the years other interests drew me to them, but I never lost that love of solving logic puzzles,
                creating effective solutions to problems, and enriching the
                lives of others by better applying the tools in my toolbox.
                When I reviewed the growth I was looking for in my career, I didn't see enough
                of this in the path ahead of me, and so I took the leap.
                <br>
                <br>
                I'm always looking to expand my network. If you want to talk career changes, jobs, or just say hi,
                I'd love to hear from you. Send me an email
                or drop me a line on LinkedIn and let's chat! You can find all that stuff just below.
