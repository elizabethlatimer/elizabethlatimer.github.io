            <h3>Hi! I'm Elizabeth.</h3>
            <p>I am a former Education Professional making the leap into the world of software development. 
                I excel in creative, relationship-oriented problem solving and systems organization. I am always excited to learn something new,
                especially when it expands the tools I have at my disposal.
                <br>
                <br>
                Maybe you're wondering about the leap from Education Administration to programming? I've been interested in manipulating what others
                see on their screens since Neopets days <sup>(thankfully, those sites have long since gone to the great server in the sky)</sup>. Through the years other interests
                drew me to them, but I never lost that love of solving logic puzzles, creating effective solutions to problems, and improving the  
                lives of others by better applying the tools in my toolbox. When I reviewed the growth I was looking for in my career, I didn't see enough
                of this in the path ahead of me, and so I took the leap. If you want to find out more about my growing skillset, head on over to my Work page.

                <br>
                I'm always looking to expand my network. If you want to talk career changes, jobs, or just say hi, I'd love to hear from you. Send me an email
                or drop me a line on LinkedIn and let's chat! You can find all that stuff just below.
