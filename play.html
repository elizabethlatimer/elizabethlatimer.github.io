            <h3>So you know who I am, and what I do, but what am I<em> like</em>?</h3>


            <p>Here are a few things I'm guaranteed to want to talk about:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Books. I love to read. I love to hear what you're reading. I love to talk about what I'm reading.</li>
                <li>Tabletop Role Playing Games. I still feel like a baby rp-er, but after 2 years of dnd, and experience in many other systems, maybe I can't claim that anymore.</li>
                <li>Food. Great new restaurants. Old favorites. Exciting new recipes. That new Bon Apetit video. A new cookbook. Holiday meal planning. Great British Bake Off....</li>
                <li>My sourdough starter. Speaking of food - isn't fermentation amazing! Let's talk healthy bacteria!</li>
                <li>My cats. They're really cute. I'd argue the cutest. Also, the many virtues of adopting bonded pairs.</li>
                <li>Traveling. I love to hear about places people have been, and share memories of great places around the world.</li>
            </ul>
