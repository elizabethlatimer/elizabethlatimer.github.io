            <h2>Current</h2>
            <p>I am a student a Rithm School in San Francisco, CA. 
                I am excited to make the transition into a field where my love of 
                using systems to creatively solve problems will get to take center stage! 
                As a graduate of the program (anticipated April 2020) I will be proficient with 
                Python, JavaScript (ES6), SQL, Flask, Node.js, Express.js, React and Redux, CSS, and HTML.
                Additionally, I will have completed a Company Project -- working on a project for a real company - 
                in a real codebase.
            </p>
